# Project-5-Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Project 5

Portland is the neighborhood I would like to visit again. 

The page loads with 4 points of interest.

Search bar can search for other places and will show a list of returned results below it.

Search results can be further filtered by rating using the radio buttons.

Clicking on either map markers or one of the search results in the list will show a Google Street View of that place as well as the air quality at that location according to the Breezometer API.

Clicking on a map marker will show a custom infobox, not the standard infowindow.

Clicking the Hide/Show tab to the right of the search results will move results off the screen for better viewing of the map.

Added responsive design changes for various sizes of screens using www.studiopress.com/responsive for testing.

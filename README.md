# Project-5-Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Project 5

Portland is the neighborhood I would like to visit again. 

The page loads with 4 points of interest.

Search bar can search for other places and will show a list of returned results below it.

Clicking on either map markers or one of the search results in the list will show a Google Street View of that place.

Clicking on a map marker will show a custom infobox, not the standard infowindow.
